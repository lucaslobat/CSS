<body>
    <h1>width & height</h1>
    <div>
        The width CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets the width of the content area, but if
        box-sizing is set to border-box, it sets the width of the border area.
    </div>
    <div>By default in the CSS box model, the width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's
        content box. If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the width and height to arrive at
        the size of the box that's rendered on the screen. This means that when you set width and height, you have to
        adjust the value you give to allow for any border or padding that may be added. For example, if you have four
        boxes with width: 25%;, if any has left or right padding or a left or right border, they will not by default fit
        on one line within the constraints of the parent container.</div>
    <div id="height">The box-sizing property can be used to adjust this behavior:

        content-box gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the
        element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final
        rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.
        border-box tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's
        width and height. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or
        padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much
        easier to size elements. box-sizing: border-box is the default styling that browsers use for the &lt;table&gt;,
        &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;button&gt; elements, and for &lt;input&gt; elements whose type is radio, checkbox,
        reset,
        button,
        submit, color, or search.

    </div>
    <div>Note: It is often useful to set box-sizing to border-box to layout elements. This makes dealing with the sizes
        of elements much easier, and generally eliminates a number of pitfalls you can stumble on while laying out your
        content. On the other hand, when using position: relative or position: absolute, use of box-sizing: content-box
        allows the positioning values to be relative to the content, and independent of changes to border and padding
        sizes, which is sometimes desirable.</div>
